                    We had gone one week without AC. We had one other HVAC company come out that thought it was going to be a huge expensive repair. We had Nathan B. come to the house and he figured it out right away! It was not as bad or expensive as the original tech from the other company had thought. Nathan had it up and running in under half an hour! Not only did he fix our AC but he found a installation issue with our water heater in our new construction home that we needed to get fixed from our original installer. He's extremely knowledgeable!

                    First heat of the summer and my air went out. called on Tuesday and they were out on Thursday morning! Nate made the repairs on my AC. He was friendly, knowledgeable and informed me every step of the way on what repairs were needed. I appreciated his suggestions for furnace filters and future maintenance as well as providing me with warranty information on my unit. Nate did a great job with the repair! Loved the friendly and attentive service!
